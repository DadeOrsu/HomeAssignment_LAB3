# Laboratory 3: Java Programming

## Course Overview

This repo contains the home assignments of Laboratory 3 course attended during my Bachelor Degree, which focuses on programming with Java. This lab provides hands-on experience with various Java concepts, including object-oriented programming, data structures, algorithms, and multithreading. Through practical exercises, you will learn how to develop efficient, robust applications in Java while understanding the intricacies of concurrent programming.

## Key Topics Covered

- **Java Basics**: Syntax, data types, and control structures.
- **Object-Oriented Programming**: Classes, objects, inheritance, polymorphism, and encapsulation.
- **Data Structures**: Implementation and usage of arrays, lists, sets, and maps.
- **Algorithms**: Common sorting and searching algorithms, including their time complexity.
- **Exception Handling**: Techniques for managing errors and exceptions in Java applications.
- **File I/O**: Reading from and writing to files using Java.
- **Multithreading**: Creating and managing threads, synchronization, and concurrent programming concepts.

## Learning Outcomes

By the end of this laboratory, you will be able to:

- Write and debug Java programs effectively.
- Implement object-oriented design principles in your code.
- Utilize data structures and algorithms to solve complex problems.
- Handle exceptions and perform file operations in Java.
- Create and manage threads to improve application performance and responsiveness.
